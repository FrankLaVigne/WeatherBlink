# WeatherBlink

WeatherBlink is a Windows 10 IoT project for an upcoming article in MSDN Magazine.

##Bill of Materials

If you simply can't wait for the article to come out, then you'll need the following:

1. Raspberry Pi 2 Model B
2. Mini SD Card
3. Solderless Breadboard
4. Two jumper cables
5. LED Light
6. 220 Ohm resistor

##Project Goals

WeatherBlink is meant for gardeners who want to start their planting early, but live in areas prone to cold weather well into Spring.  It pulls down weather forecast data.  If the forecast low is near freezing (39F/3.3C), the LED light will blink rapidly.  Otherwise, the LED blinks slowly.
